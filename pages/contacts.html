<p>Special exhibitions are storytelling in three dimensionsâ€”and all show science as a process and a way of being and thinking in the world.
    You can add one or more ticketed exhibitions (which include walk-through, giant-screen film, or the planetarium Space Show) before checkout.
    Extinct and Endangered is included with regular Admission and does not need to be added to your ticket.</p>
